# InstagramBOT

The application in conjuction with the API (InstagramBOT_API repository) was intended to automate the process of building a community on Instagram. The InstagramBOT application offers a primitive user interface through which we can observe that the real-time operation are performed on our Instagram account. The app combined with the API is ineffective - so much that we can be sure that the inflicted account will get banned (it's only a matter of time). Due to the Instagram platform's very restrictive approach to similar creations, the project was abandoned.
